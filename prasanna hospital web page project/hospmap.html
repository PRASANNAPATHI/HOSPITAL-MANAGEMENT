<h2 id="surgery" style="text-align:center; font-family: verdana; color: darkblue"><b>EMERGENCY WARD</b></h2>
<p  style="font-family: arial; text-align: center;"><b>
<br><br>	Sudden illness or injury can occur without warning, and while no one typically plans a trip to the Emergency Department, 
<br>everyone should know what to expect after they arrive. The Emergency Department (ED) at PRASANNA HOSPITAL provides urgent 
<br>care to patients who have traumatic injury, major illnesses or other issues that require immediate treatment. The staff 
<br>includes physicians, nurses and other healthcare professionals who follow specific procedures so that you can get the 
<br>care you need as quickly as possible.
</b></p>

<br>
<h2 id="emergency" style="text-align:center; font-family: verdana; color: darkblue"><b>SURGERY WARD</b></h2>
<p  style="font-family: arial; text-align: center;"><b>
<br><br>	A well-designed surgical suite provides ample space for staff and equipment. It encourages a smooth flow of people and 
<br>materials within the room. While the layout of an individual surgical suite varies by surgical service, all suites share 
<br>some characteristics, as described in below.

<br><br>	The size of the operating suite should reflect the space required by the patient, staff, and equipment to carry out the 
<br>surgical procedure. The standard surgical suite is at least 400 square feet. Surgical suites that require specialized equipment 
<br>or additional personnel can be significantly larger. It is important to provide space so that sensitive medical equipment is not 
<br>positioned in high-traffic areas. The shape of an operating suite can take on a variety of forms, (e.g., square, rectangular, round, 
<br>or oval), depending on design preferences and overall operating room layout.

<h2 id="admin" style="text-align:center; font-family: verdana; color: darkblue"><b>ADMINISTRATION CONTROL ROOM</b></h2>
<p  style="font-family: arial; text-align: center;"><b>
<br><br>	The control room is an extension of the office of medical superintendent meant to address various administrative
<br>issues encountered during hospital operations. It ensured 24 × 7 availability of a qualified and trained hospital 
<br>administrator in a hospital set-up where operations continue to prevail incessantly. A single control room catered 
<br>to a conglomerate of the main hospital and six specialties/super specialty centers comprising of more than 2000 inpatient beds.
